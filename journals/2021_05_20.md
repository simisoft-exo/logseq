- 08:44 - had my first bjj class and I loved it
	 - I need to be more gentle

	 - I need to not hurry my movements, especially when sparring. Had to situations where I could have broken my partner's fingers or he mine.

	 - TODO practice fastening the belt such that it's a non-issue at the next class

	 - I don't always get the technique right and it could be useful to watch some videos and see the principle behind the movements

	 - [[May 1st, 2022]] - year long check for bjj
		 - I aim to get a blue belt, or be a few months away from getting it

		 - [[May 1st, 2022]] - I'm on my third stripe, and on my way to get the blue belt.
