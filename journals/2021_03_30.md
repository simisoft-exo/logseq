	 - idea 2
		 - https://youtu.be/yUSyMqDUkv8

		 - accounts for energy use for sitting

		 - variety is with the most benefit rather than a right upright

		 - straight spine might be as bad as slouched if it stays in place

		 - fixing posture will fix your pain
			 - might not be good

		 - can fix poor with simple daily drills?
			 - are they sufficient?
				 - no

			 - better off with resistance training in the long run

			 - fixing pain might not mean I'm fixing the posture

		 - is it a problem worth fixing?
			 - might lead to nocebo pain

			 - just moving might be better

		 - solution
			 - 2-3 days of resistance training
				 - compound exercises

			 - regular cardio routine for joint health

			 - vary posture throughout the day

			 - perception of pain might be influenced by stress and sleep, besides posture
