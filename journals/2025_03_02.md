		 - date with Stacey - South African from joburg 
			 - let it run for too long, should've ended it as soon as she didn't respond to getting close to me and kept with the small talk, as well when I made a comment about the "bad boys" and rugby
				 - I should've broken it earlier, in 5 min, not 45 min.

				 - she found or acted "weird" when I mentioned soft lips and hands
					 - my mistake was not leading into being more explicit and flirtatious to polarize and end it if she wasn't into me that much

					 - I didn't feel strongly for her, but enough to desire getting in that direction
						 - compared to the portuguese finger biter and indian girl that were into me she showed low interest like the bulgarian girl

						 - she mentioned the "awkward" silence, but I noticed the same with the indian chick when she wanted to move things outside/get cigarrettes after she shared her beer with me. Even with that one I should've kissed her right there and then, the move outside.

		 - date with Dominika - polish
			 - she stayed where I placed her, reacted being taken aback, but went on

			 - flirted starting from which swear words she is using. seemed shy to use them
				 - went abrupt and hard saying I’d want her to be my little Slavic bitch in the bedroom

				 - I can turn this into a pattern/flirting game

			 - she wasn’t giggly or showed much of a reaction when I complimented her lips or eyes

			 - I was again tense & fidgety until I let myself say what went thru my mind

			 - patterns of silence
				 - like she was expecting to get back to small talk? as she said why I’m just looking at her and not saying anything

		 - one flake

		 - date with Kate - ended in 5-7 min at "get to know each other"
			 - started a bit annoyed that she asked to move earlier and was late

			 - we sat at the table and within 5 minutes of sitting she
				 - didn't cooperate to get closer so I can hear her better

				 - made a comment about one of her accessories, and didn't hear much of her

				 - she kept doing the "interview" and I started getting arrogant
					 - I asked that I breathe for a living
						 - more specifically, air

				 - I wanted to move it to be more flirty and said it's hard to answer this kind of questions, she's too sexy for that
					 - she said something along the lines of things not being about that, and we should get to know each other

					 - told her this is a date, if she doesn't feel it than we shouldn't waste our time

					 - told her I appreciate taking the time to show up

					 - picked my jacked and left
						 - she looked shocked and sent me a voice note afterwards that I didn't listen

					 -
