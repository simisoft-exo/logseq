		 - went on two dates
			 - first one was on, felt natural
				 - we kissed only at the end of the date and after she proposed we get some cigarettes, regret not going more agressive and taking her home

				 - suspicions after date (if I decide on when things get serious?)
					 - she doesn’t state the usual long term bs that most girls do, and on the date she said she’s usually deciding on the date 
						 - she wants to see how clever is on the bait and switch from casual or she’s just honest?

					 - photos are a mix of selfies, pictures by friends and pro photoshoot ones, especially the one with heat leather jacket

					 - she didn’t use her real name on the app - used Aisha, but told me later it’s Ela from Orendrela or something Bengali like that

					 - her profile says AI geek, but she mentioned she’s a marketer that’s doing an AI master at queen mary’s on a scholarship 

					 - she said she wanted to show me pictures of her parents on instagram but didn’t show them to me by then we changed subject

					 - she looks good and kisses well but I think her jaw line is the result of good makeup and she knows western guys like that

			 - second one came to the wrong place, didn’t hug, didn’t make eye contact at all, from the get go and for the 20 or so minutes I attempted a conversation with her. looked around and at the TV the whole time, checked her watch and phone. feel I shouldn’t even went for the drinks the moment she checked her Apple Watch when we were heading for the pub
