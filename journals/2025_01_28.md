		 - should I go for more dates same day ( can organize )
			 - pros
				 - get used to doing more, I felt more confident on the second one after the first one

				 - getting less needy

			 - cons
				 - can only take home the second one if it goes well

				 - more to process

				 - can make more mistakes as I get tired, I'm not an introvert
					 - can solve by having alone time or walk between the dates
						 - one early (less interest, second option), one late (high interest, first option)

				 - give me more to plan a second date, but I would need to decide, and it would have to show high interest with sexual interest, just not with sex on first date

			 - pro or cons?
				 - becoming colder and shorter in my messages as I don't have the time to chat, just to schedule since I have a lot going on

				 - 

		 - or should I aim only for one per day
			 - pros
				 - can be more chill about planning and scheduling

			 - cons
				 - I take more time to build my communication skills
