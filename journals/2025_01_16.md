				 - she seemed to hover before meeting

			 - Questions they ask
				 - is this working for you (when I go direct and check sexual interest, e.g. telling her I want to get naked with her)

				 - have you been long on the apps

				 - are you seeing somebody else

				 - how are you getting along with your flat mates
					 - do you have any friends you're seeing?

			 - Discussing hobbies

			 - Handling the fuckboy vibe
				 - when they want it, but not sure about me being the right now guy
					 - ((efb5c1ef-b9f2-4bf3-a4d6-a313ae2a550e))  - mentioned getting attached when it's just sex
						 - told her I want it to be fun, and I hope it turns into fun that will get to last a long time

						 - this "what I want" type of question when I bring up sex, or getting aroused they also come with how will I or how will she handle it, because of "catching" feelings
							 - from your calls I heard you tell them it's only going to be sex and not dates until it's consistent. Do you make it clear in the first conversation that you "promote" them to dates if they are consistent for a while, so you're not the situationship guy that keeps putting the relationship in the future, but never gets there.

							 - catching feeling
								 - she's out there with guys that just want sex

								 - for me she expected different because she perceived me as different

				 - she said she will develop feelings and can’t easily let go

			 - conversation 
				 - how many dates until sex
					 - she said one then two

					 - complained about it but stayed

				 - took it gradually
					 - first said her lips look delicious and she laughed without saying anything

					 - then I told her it’s hard to focus on what she’s saying (true) as I was thinking we should get naked together
						 - objected to bringing it up so early in conversation 

						 - used an ARC line - lowered my voice and asked her to tell me she doesn’t like getting naked - she complied and said she liked getting naked

			 - Got needy towards the end
				 - there were silence where I only thought about getting my hands on her and didn’t have something to pick on smoothly, so I was abrupt

			 - Dates I don't feel strong attraction to
				 - how quickly should I end them
					 - she suggested a different place

					 - she started complaining about dating in London

					 - 

		 - what does he mean I gotta be cold. it 

		 - Texting
			 - using his texts
				 - how many texts back and forth

			 - using my texts
				 - 4, 3 or 2 days

				 - 3, 2 or 1 days

		 - Profile
			 - Bio
				 - example
