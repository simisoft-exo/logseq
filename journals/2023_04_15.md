- I've spent years laying in bed, masturbating with the pillows and mattress. It is my comfort zone to leave a party early without hitting on the girls I like and coming back home to stay isolated

- My most used excuses:
	 - I'm not experienced enough

	 - I'm boring

	 - I have social anxiety

	 - I'm introverted

	 - The women I'm interested in aren't interested in me

- While I've managed to get into better material, financial and physical shape I still lack socially and with intimacy

- Self limiting beliefs:
	 - I'm inexperienced
		 - this is not true - I've had sex with about 30 women, so I surely have done something right and have some experience to draw upon

	 - I'm boring
		 - yes, I have a habit of being monotonous and bringing up controversial topics

		 - I have been entertaining to the argentine (Sami) girl from cali footwork telling about the work I do

	 - All the good women are taken
		 - this doesn't mean there are no good women that I can meet and join the group of guys that have the good taken women

- Toxic shame
	 - I have violent fantasies of rejecting, as well as of being rejected after I managed to get to be with somebody and they ask something of me which I don't want to give

	 - I have violent fantasies where I take revenge when I'm being cheated on

	 - These come up out of my fear of being abandoned once I get with somebody, and that I'm unlovable

- What am I afraid a woman might find out about me if she really got to know me?
	 - that I have some for of autism and it is hard for me to read emotions while speaking in real time and communication with me would be difficult because of this reason
		 - how do I know this to be true?
			 - I've had two relationships fail because of this reason, as those partners called me "weird" because of the way I look at things

	 - that I have spent time in sex positive communities and I have both reasons for and against being monogamous with somebody and I can't tell which one would be with her and at which point

	 -
