- #abundance-retreat
	 - i still feel like going on for a couple more years as a software dev, but to start progressing financially and in responsibility

	 - i want to have a lifestyle that would attract and sustain relationships with girls like E

	 - I want a life I would love as much as my projection for E created abundance
		 - anything less is not worth it

		 - only alternative is finding a person that would get to there

	 - self-rejection because I could not sustain a lifestyle with somebody like E

	 - obsessing over E
		 - best reason to stop - it's an opportunity cost to find somebody who will reciprocate, instead I'm spending time on handing the intensity of my projections and attempts to seduce when things got to a clear distance

		 - as easy as it was to move my fantasies away from memories with M and J towards E, so it will be to have E fade from my consciousness, as pleasant as her company is, it's not an important thing to do.

		 - be ruthless about this to the end of it, as I already was, but I'm not true to my decision to fall out of the infatuation

		 - my attention is valuable, and I need to value it myself first. I'm never going to get my time and attention back from things that don't provide me what I need or seek.

	 - comes to my mind to surrender to the difficulty and carry the load that it takes to change myself to make it easier to reveal what I have that's already attractive as well as do what it takes to meet more people and make new friends
