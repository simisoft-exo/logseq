- 13:37 - I've got fairly sad today - thoughts of suicide, of running away from my misery crop to my mind
	 - this state of mind is a strong source of black and white thinking

	 - it also crops to my mind to dare again an adventure
		 - this time to the Andes for a few weeks

		 - and then take on Lambda School (6 months) from Latin America and attempt a remote job with a US or UK company
			 - they only have two tracks: web and data science
				 - for web - I don't like it as that's what I'm doing now
					 - it might be easier to go up on the people's "senior engineer", not the IC.

					 - for starting my own business, which comes to my mind from time to time this seems to be the way to go

					 - I'm not enjoying at this point that I can't focus completing most of the technical tasks and I need to context switch between a lot of discussions, bug fixes and so on.

					 - there are more opportunities for this

					 - in higher demand than data science

				 - for data science
					 - I might like it more because I'm mathematically inclined

					 - might not be as good for the people's part

					 - might pay better

					 - might be harder to start my own business if I specialise on this

					 - I need to deal with business stakeholders more than with web as the application needs to be applied to the business and they might not understand very well how it works

					 - probably need to work at a large company

- design a data store for roam custom components
