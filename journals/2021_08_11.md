- [[August 12th, 2021]]
	 - DONE raise ticket about getting available rules and categories metadata for a version/active-version
		 - would help debug faster operational issues, like the one we had with JCDECAUX_AU (would also be useful to add who made the call - e.g. `user-agent`)

		 - change errors reported from `unknown` to `missing or haven't been data has not been uploaded`. Unknown is useful for an API consumer, but not as useful for a QA person. Error messaging is meant for people, not for machines.

	 - TODO  add `schedule` end point and an additional polling thread to optimus with another message type that would schedule a publish event

	 - TODO add entry in support docs about creating new markets (even add an endpoint that would do that so we avoid the hassle of going thru optimus)
