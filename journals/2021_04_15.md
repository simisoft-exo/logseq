- had the interview with Juxt. Jon delayed by a few weeks, which means he wants to give a lower deal on the money
	 - I guess he also wants somebody who would be fully in

- felt angry and defeated after the interview. played a game of chess and blundered badly. Could have check mated had I used the en passant rule, by I offered my queen for a pawn and resigned. 

- I'm thinking of doing the chess game DSL in roam such that I can track my games and jot down my ideas here, with a chess board where I can follow the ideas along the graph, and make the connections between the games

- I'm solely responsible for feeling like crap and not doing what needs to be done. I lay in bed masturbating half a day, then I feel like crap and not perform well in interviews or in solving programming problems.

- had some "brazilian" sirloin - seems I need to cook it the same day, otherwise it doesn't taste very good, and it seems it had more fat that I could take in
