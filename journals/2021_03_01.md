	 - I heard the birds sing this morning

- It's bugging me
	 - that it's very hard to switch from a requirements and business discussion context to the technical one and I'm expected at interviews to be able to do it within an hour or so of discussion and coding

- 18:21 - after work
	 - I feel desiring to finish mulog, start the tetris kata or implement a habit tracker component within Roam

	 - the most enthusiastic I feel about is the habit tracker part

	 - DONE finish mulog [[March 2nd, 2021]]

- Kata
	 - Tetris Kata
