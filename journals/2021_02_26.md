	 - I got drunk once again on half a bottle of japanese whiskey

- Is there anything bugging me?
	 - Yes, I find it very hard to do the requirements clarification step and the whole business context - when it's confusing as hell

	 - my mind just goes numb when I hear people not knowing what they want

	 - I spend a good deal of time to clarify to myself what I want

	 - I dislike I have to do the whole thing live and then be expected to be able to solve the problem fast when solving technical problems is a whole different area in my thinking - and the two are not compatible

	 - I feel overwhelmed by how much I need to learn, and every thing I need to learn doesn't have as much context as I'd like connected to previous work

	 - The only thing that's seems to be in common is that I go through the understand - plan - implement - check loop, applied to domains that are context dependent and it's hard to translate between the different contexts

	 - I know I would get into many of the same problems if I were to run my own business - as sorting out the chaos of the world is not easy

	 - Though I wouldn't use the same tools that I see used at my job
		 - I'd still go for a basecamp like arrangement - just not to have stress that steals my life away

	 - it's bugging me that I don't like front-end development and that I feel quite incompetent for back-end development

- Of all the things that bug me it's work now
	 - beyond it feeling overwhelming

	 - there is the question of leading myself to better applications

	 - while I'm still not understanding very well the ones I have to work on
