- I feel sad again. I've had a negative mood almost all day, after I drank some wine last night.
	 - Feeling sad because of the trance of remembering the dance anxiety and that I tanked again two days ago, and skipped bachata night yesterday

	 - One of the heaviest burdens on my soul is my social and relationship failure
		 - I keep saying this yet I feel I'm not doing anything about it

		 - I keep running away to playing impulsive chess and scrolling instead of doing any of the things I listed could improve my situation

		 -
