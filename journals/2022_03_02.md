- re-read bits of Shape-up [[March 3rd, 2022]]
	 - Size I'm doing it
		 - small enough to wing it
			 - I'm doing the shaping, betting&pitching is getting buy in from managers and then I get on building

			 - Using a few ideas to make it easier to discuss the work, though it's mostly backend work it's an organized bullet list of features, requirements and risks
				 - managed to get the R&D/first cycle (work takes about 6 weeks anyway)
					 - but since everybody thinks that's too long (that's what happens anyway) I have to size it in terms of 2 week sprints

				 - R&D/first cycle
					 - make the biggest unknowns known

					 - have the minimal feature that would save the company most time

					 - find out how the trade-offs I pitched would turn out

					 - have a testable integration environment
						 - this is important for back-end work, you can get away with it on the front-end.

					 - cut as many scope and corners without limiting migration speed or data integrity
						 - some of the decisions are not obvious in the code beucase I'm the only one who understands why it's possible to cut the corners that way

					 - show the tasks that aren't there
						 - the growing list is useful to re-shape the next phases of development

		 - I'm alternating between shaping and building myself.
			 - had a week of "shaping" work and now it happens more ad-hoc, when I create tickets for
