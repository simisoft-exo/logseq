	 - I went for a workout outside - 2x1 min hollow hold, a round of kongs and a round of slowed down kongs

	 - I left my job at Uswitch, fulfilling my resignation contract when I joined

	 - I re-read `You Learn` by Borges

	 - I re-read the failure notes that I wrote before moving to London in 2017

- It's easy to make an employee quit
	 - you just stop giving them the support and projects they would need

	 - and they break down, or under-perform enough to be fired

- Life as an engineer
	 - you solve a problem and find 5 more

	 - you try to be proactive to see 5 potential problems and end up spending a lot of time on that instead of the solution

	 - which can make delivery quite late

- Gulag Archipelago
	 - one of the most important ideas is that people who decide to live with a good conscience regardless whether that brought more hardship onto them ended up surviving better than those who didn't

	 - the will to survive was really important, yet the will to survive without breaking yourself or your conscience was equally important

	 - the sufferings produced individuals who got enriched, Solzhenitsyn calls it the Ascent.

	 - Solzhenitsyn at Harvard
		 - he talks about the authority of fashion over the West's free speech and how the West has lost it's civil courage

- It's hair raising that the Communist regimes were so brutal yet many individuals who got tangled in opposing them proved to be strong enough to put their lives on the line and made the regimes persist their version of hell because they would not give in to the pain and a good conscience was above all that

- House Design
	 - make sure the smells don't travel through the house to other rooms

- Chess
	 - playing chess I meet with my insecurity, my limitations of thinking under pressure

	 - there is now way to bullshit or go around the game

	 - it's a mirror into one's effort to get better at something

	 - even if there are no hard consequences like with Parkour, being honest with one's study, mistakes and patterns is the only way to improve, there is no getting better from game to game if there is no self-reflection and brutal honesty about what needs to be done to get better at it

	 - Lectii cu Mircea Parligras
		 - [[April 28th, 2021]]
			 - jocul initial 
				 - https://www.chess.com/a/2Kc4YM39G2Fgzr

			 - Am analizat Fischer Vs Reshevski

			 - Discutie
				 - am avut un atac prematur pe d5
					 - m-a pus in pozitia sa-mi impiedice dezvoltarea
						 - un simplu avans a pionului imi ataca nebunul, si imi facea toata pozitia mult mai slaba

					 - era mai bine sa recapturez - nu avea intentia sa ma atace inapoi

					 - mutarea calului care a continuat atacul
						 - regula - in general e bine sa nu fac doua mutari cu aceeasi piesa in deschidere

				 - rocada a fost o greseala fiindca nu puteam recapura piesele ce atacau regele dupa.

				 - atacul intial chiar daca agresiv m-a pus intr-o pozitie mai slaba iar dupa schimburi albul era pe avantaj material, iar apoi tot ce avea de facut era sa se dezvolte

- Radical accountability
	 - [[April 3rd, 2021]]
		 - Today I'd like to keep myself accountable to how I use my time

		 - First thing in the morning is doing the hollow holds, then every hour or so I done one of the office exercises

		 - I keep track of how I focus and spend my time throughout the day

		 - I devise a new accountability sheet
