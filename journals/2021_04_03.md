- 08:19
	 - opened eyes around 7.40

	 - managed to sleep on my back, not embracing the pillow or the blanket
		 - did not masturbate when I fell asleep or got up

	 - got out of bed at 8

	 - 08:10 picked up laundry from kitchen

- 08:15 - 08:20
	 - did the 2 one minute hollow hold and a 20 sec third one

- at 13 I need to be on island of dogs to do some parkour with Ahmad
	 - so I need to leave around 12

- 08:50 - 09:11 - zero legs

- 10:00  - finishing mulog contribution, adding more precise test 
	 - facing my own shame for not doing the whole work and having Bruno do work after me

- 10:02 - checked e-mail as I felt anxious about my mulog contrib

- 10:02 - thinking about how bad my coding habits are

- 10:08 - did the merge to get up to date - felt better about doing it 

- 10:09 - 10:13 - checked phone - cleaned the desk of dust - avoiding

- 10:24 - the enemy is my laziness, the confused mind
	 - confusion - when I mistake one thing for another

	 - when i'm not impeccable with doing what I intended to do

- 10:29 - mind wanders at how I failed the Funding Circle pairing interview

- 10:51 - checked e-mail and twitter

- 11:01 - got angry at the code
	 - I can stay, feeling defeated and continuing feeling defeated the whole day for feeling defeated earlier

	 - Or I can fight off for a small change, and change my own conditioning of laziness and self-defeat

- 11:31 - checked phone
	 - managed to get mulog work well with pairs
		 - update docs

		 - write tests for each case

		 - follow-up with Bruno

- 12:13
	 - went for a walk for about 10 minutes

	 - thinking of how Mihai reacted when I told him I quit my job
		 - he expected me to stay longer, even if I don't like it

		 - seems people do a lot of justification to keep staying in job they don't like\

		 - it makes sense as they can get paid very well

		 - though, it also creates a environment where one does memetic competition with friends on who's rewarded best within a company

- 12:22
	 - looking at the phone

- 16:47 - I've got out of staying in bet
	 - at 12.40 went out for training parkour outside until ~14:48

	 - cooked some sausage with mamaliga - ate it

	 - played a game of chess - won against a 700+ rating player

	 - ((b4deec32-7fa7-4222-86b7-45ceeb8314c1)) until now - so that's more than an hour

	 - masturbated twice close to the point of coming

- 17:12 - added tests and addressed all comments for my mulog contribution
	 - what's next?

	 - TODO make progress with using Crux in Juxt's tech challenge

	 - TODO play more with laziness and prepare for the tech interview with VIOOH

	 - TODO prepare for the tech interview with Juxt

- 18:17 - went to Tesco - got some groceries

- 18:18 - looking at amazon prime - not "feeling like doing it"

- 20:34 - watched a movie - The Negotiator
	 - feel as drained like after masturbating when I know I should have done something better with my time
