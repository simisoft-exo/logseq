	 - closed guard
		 - got caught in a cross collar grip choke

		 - was able to hold it for a while but I caved in to pressure

		 - best defense is to get rid of the first arm that gets around as soon as I realise it's there
			 - it's the first time a white belt succeeds in finishing it

		 - noticed that I could also go for the kimura sweep off a failed hip bump or scissor sweep
			 - I need to time picking up the hand that goes to the ground with the failed sweep and with switching to get and overhook to get the kimura sweep properly
