		 - LOST - roshirizvi https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/15187439119?tab=report
			 - early queen attack game

			 - queen captured my pawn, i should have brought out the bishop, not the queen for the exchange, to prepare for tempo attacks on the next moves

			 - opponent moved on to develop their pawns while I started developing my pieces

			 - it made it easier for them as they took up space while I was getting tempo attacks on the knights

			 - on move 12 I thought it would be a good idea to keep my knight close to his king, and to avoid exchanging the other knight. it would have been better to bring the knight close to the king
				 - I put my knight in a place where it was taken for free

			 - I would have been better of bringing my white squared bishop into the action instead of focusing on counter attacking her pawn development

		 - LOST - resigned because I didn't see a way I could win in a bad position. Also, didn't pay attention to a discovered attack on the queen

			 - It was a "symmetrical" italian game where we both developed the same pieces in the same places

			 - I castled king side and castling queen side was a better option as the king side had the bishops pointed at it and the center had the queen and the rook active

			 - the opponent avoided trades

			 - I decided to support a weak pawn that was attacked by a rook supported by the queen and the black squared bishop with my own bishop. I was concerned of weakening my king by advancing the king pawn to support the weak pawn, but it might have been a better idea

			 - strategically it was a closed game where I had bad bishop which weren't doing much except defend pawns, which I ended up losing and the opponent got control of the center

			 - also made the mistake of losing the queen for a rook, and also the bishop when the opponent discovered an attack on the queen

			 - my plan was to double the rooks on my side too, but it failed because I lost the queen and the opponent managed to support the queen with a rook and I had no way of giving checks

		 - LOST - more positional game which weakened its F pawn

			 - developed it's pawns early taking up more space
				 - i castled and they advanced pawns on my king side while even if I developed my pieces

				 - I made the mistake of trying to control the center by sacrificing pawns instead of fending off the bishop

				 - once we exchanged bishops I got tempo attacks on the rook

				 - I had the advantage and I lost it with checks that didn't lead to meaningful captures or checkmate

				 - I could've made an alekhines gun and the victory would have been decisive, even if i lost the bishop

		 - LOST - early queen game where I got the development advantage but blundered by trying to keep up my tempo attacks against the queen instead of choosing better moves 
			 - https://www.chess.com/game/live/15278612575

			 - after my queen tempo attack I decided to defend the white undefended bishop with the queen instead of the knight
				 - which made for giving away both my knight and bishop for a knight

				 - I recovered by recapturing a knight and had the advantage

				 - I delayed giving a knight for a rook by giving a check as my knight was in a good position for that and decided to advance my queen side pawns
					 - had I done this it would have been a bishop vs rook endgame and I could have easily promoted one of my queenside pawns

		 - LOST - had my development used against me (again) by tempo attacks against my bishop using pawns (and gaining space)
			 - https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/15367326113

			 - I got my bishops in a bad position
