- Today I went on a long walk.
	 - resented and hated all those I worked with

	 - and didn't see more opportunities coming my way
		 - offline accounts

		 - and getting Kristin as a line mangerish 
			 - which is even newer than Graeme

			 - or Tim

	 - at some point I cried
		 - then I went and did 12 pull-ups, took a 15 sec break did 3 more, 15 sec break did 4 more, I became angry instead of depressed. Put on the weight west, did 3 with 5 kg and 10 pushups with legs on the bed

	 - decided the next 9 days are about doing 1000 pullups
		 - {{calc  (1000/9)}} per day
id:: c72a0937-89c0-45d6-862a-a7769ea00e12
			 - in eight sets every two hours

		 - {{calc  ((c72a0937-89c0-45d6-862a-a7769ea00e12)) / 8}} - per set
