- came last night

- managed to last from Monday ~08:00 [[April 12th, 2021]] until Thursday ~23:00[[April 15th, 2021]]
	 - that is 3 days and 16 hours.

	 - I'm aiming for 5 days, which means [[April 21st, 2021]]

- ambiguity should be a signal to become imaginative and put in the work

- what would it mean to put in the work as a software engineer?

- do I still want to continue on that path?

- I still believe my calling is entrepreneurial and I don't have the courage to start again

- I wasted hours after yesterday failure with Juxt

- The worse I can do is keep in this state of discouragement throughout the days of unemployment

- The ideas I have for today
	 - apply for some companies again: Griffin, Pitch, 

- Make each hour count
	 - first hour - 08:58 - 09:55
		 - writing about my ideal day
			 - interrupted quite a number of times by twitter and facebook

			 - only managed to get to what I do after breakfast, what about the rest of the day?

	 - second hour - 09:56
		 - noticed I keep procrastinating on applying for jobs

		 - said I'm going to "prepare" and opened 9 tabs with applications in US and UK telling myself I'm going to "polish" my application and send it on Sunday evening or Monday morning

		 - why not today?

	 - third hour - 11:30
		 - applying online for more jobs

		 - clicked (took 5 minutes) to apply at - https://www.works-hub.com/applied
			 - medino

			 - elcom

			 - sound united

		 - went for a walk

	 - fourth hour - 12:20
		 - setup clojure in Spacemacs

	 - fifth hour - 14:01
		 - self stimulated until came

	 - sixth hour - 15:00
		 - lied in bed, played a game of chess

	 - seventh hour - 16:00
		 - headed to Parkour and wasn't in a very disciplined state of mind.

		 - did a bunch of jumps and cat leaps, yet I feel dead

- I said I don't care about their product, yet, do I care about my life?
	 - I'm still in "not enough progress" made for getting a job

- Plan the Dartmoon fasting trek

- re-frame my work stories from a leading perspective (or how would they sound from a leading perspective)

- do the board/chess game DSL from software flexibility

- I feel I failed to convey the value I could have brought to Juxt

- I've also felt angry at Spacemacs today for entering a mode I didn't know how to get out of when I pressed Ctrl+Z by accident

- Do the Uber API System Design in practice for printing a few pages using repl.it

- TODO [[April 17th, 2021]] - flag the error for partition-with with Renzo - [[May 8th, 2021]]
