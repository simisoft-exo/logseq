- Is there anything bugging me?
	 - yes - can I have a review sheet for the systems design

	 - I don't feel prepared enough for the interviews so I'm thinking of delaying  them towards the end of the week and take Friday off to do the systems design and engineering manager ones while doing the Pair Programming ones on Thursday - this gives me one or two more days to prepare.

	 - I don't feel I rehearsed enough my answers or that I can come up with alternatives during the Systems design interview
