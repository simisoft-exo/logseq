- Writing of the day
	 - Online foolery
		 - For years I've been hoarding self development materials. Yet, I still am not doing as they promised. I'm spending on it as if it is a vice and I'm not getting more out of it than I would get out of my father's common sense advice. The ancients seem to hard, the modern self development snake salesman seem more digestible, yet much less wise. I still feel like a fool, scrolling Twitter for hours, and getting nothing out of it.
