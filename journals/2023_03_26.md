- been on a spontaneous date with a swiss german woman after I got back from Zurich on friday - [[March 24th, 2023]]
	 - opened with a comment about how hard it was to cut some vine leaf dumpling at the lebanese restaurant 

	 - had a chain of coincidences
		 - she was having late dinner because of London, me because of Switzerland

	 - other thoughts
		 - wasn't as aggressive as last time when a made a same day or next day pull where my hands were all over the woman back then
			 - I didn't feel 

	 - what went well
		 - she responded well to my teasing

		 - I was authentic, even if that meant being rejected because had strong opinions

		 - I was comfortable with myself as I was

	 - what didn't go well:
		 - i wanted to feel more sexual desire towards her, but I didn't, felt more like wanting to know her
			 - here I'm not sure about whether I could've "worked" towards the desire, but I'm in doubt, I might have acted out of desperation of not getting sex for a long time

		 - I expected more, especially as we danced salsa on the street before saying goodbye after having drinks at the bar

		 - let myself into too intellectual and nerdy talk, especially about my doubt about mainstream western issues like climate change
			 - #tough-convos
				 - can talk about it and I need to make things clearer to reduce the perception that I'm a stupid contrarian
					 - I can say something like: `I can tell you what I think, though there's a chance you might disagree with how I view things on the [whatever issue]`

					 - I can simply listen, acknowledge and change the subject, there is no good reason to ruin a good vibe. She can find out when we'd like to get to know each other better.

					 - 

		 - over-shared about myself

		 - didn't touch her before the dance to get closer together, let only the intellectual vibe keep going, and that is not enough for a romantic/sexual adventure

		 - ended up bitter and even hating women today after she decided not to come to the dance class in Putney
			 - i deleted her number and the chat, fuck yes or no

			 - it's not productive or useful for me to feel bitter for something that's outside my control and I could have been grateful I've had such an encounter, since it's been years since I've hit such good vibes with somebody, yet I was unsatisfied and expected more

- ideal dwelling place for climate disaster in Rozavlea for the family:

	 - passive cooled for hot summer, burried underground for cheap heating during winters

	 - storage for food for 1 year of famine for 6-8 people

	 - diesel and fuel reserve for 1 year

	 - ground heat pump

	 - independent electricity from the grid (solar + batteries)

- #dating #questions
	 - relationship with parents and siblings
		 - what's one thing you know your parents did that led to you getting a better life than they did?
