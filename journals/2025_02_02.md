		 - date with Victoria
			 - pattern of trying to hard when she says no or shows resistance either subtly with this one or more direct with the other ones

			 - it’s started badly from the moment  was agitated and crossed the street to meet her instead of telling her to cross the street

			 - pedestalising her too much because she was french ( and had that elegance about her)
				 - I was too tense, and hesitant

			 - was tense from the beginning
				 - she played hard to get, or tried to sell me on her wholesomeness

				 - she was physically attracted to me, but kept distance as she wasn't looking into my eyes, but at my lips

			 - she asked if I’m shy and then went on and on talking too much

			 - was talking about it instead of being about it

			 - We were discussing art and I wanted to steer the conversation towards flirting. I told her the french have some of the best erotic literature out there and she said it's vulgar

			 - you look as sexy as in your pictures
				 - I said it's hard to focus on all this professional stuff when you're this sexy. I'm looking at your lips, they look very full and appetising. I think we should try each other's lips soon.
					 - she said some bullshit around not this time

			 - I said I'm generally not talking too much as she asked if I'm shy
				 - I said I'm not shy, I can be quite uninhibited

			 - She looked at my lips repeatedly but I was too tense to come up with something about that
				 - I could've said - you say you want to take it easy, yet you keep looking at my lips. I want to hear that you're not thinking about

			 - she ended it
				 - we were talking about civilization and I argued that only empires have it, and she asked if romanians have it
					 - I said that we should do some uncivilized things
