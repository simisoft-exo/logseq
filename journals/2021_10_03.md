		 - just for today
			 - I will not `complain`, I will `practice gratitude` 

		 - swap 1 - anger
			 - getting angry at some program not working-> stopping breathing 4 times deeply

		 - swap 2 - nom
			 - nom -> going for a walk or massaging shoulders and back, or writing it down (keep the mini-journal close to me)

		 - swap 3 - twitter
			 - scrolling twitter -> writing down an idea in Roam

		 - swap 4 - complaining
			 - complaining that something is hard -> being grateful for something and writing down a plan about what I'm struggling with
