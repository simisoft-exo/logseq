	 - went for a takedown with Bruno and harmed the gripping strength in my left arm. I can train, but if I'm to go for competition it will be hard to keep confidence when I tell myself that my left arm is too vulnerable to fight and compete. I can't rely my conclusions about my ability on weaker partners, and I need to find a way to build my confidence despite my left arm and knee weakness. So far my knees hold well with the rehab and will continue with that but I need to do better with my left arm.
