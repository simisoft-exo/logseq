	 - Kinetic art piece 2025
		 - **"What are the 3-5 specific pieces or concepts from my light and motion work that give me the most satisfaction or align most closely with my artistic vision?"**
			 - the sounds and rhythms

			 - the light and light patterns

			 - syncing physical and light motion

			 - effects
				 - surprise

				 - calming fire-like, meditative

				 - other orchestrations and the reactions that people will have

		 - **"If I had to describe the unique value or perspective my art brings to viewers in one sentence, what would it be?"**
			 - a reaction that a lot of people who saw it for the first time say "haven't seen something like this before", and they might be art collectors, or other visual/interactive creatives. People who don't have a strong connection with art find it enjoyable to watch.

		 - **"What practical constraints (time, materials, space, technical knowledge) am I working within, and how might these help me focus rather than limit me?"**
			 - I want to design a brighter, higher color resolution LED module (16bit) and do a daisy chainable actuators per board

			 - I should constrain myself to simply way more and cut from the complexity and complications I want to do with the piece, as I risk not doing anything and dabbling being a dilettante instead of a maker

			 - I don't have a lot of time as I'm doing it a few hours a week, and that includes everything: design, assembly, testing, coding, editing and promoting

			 - I only have about two months with the current space and workshop after which I might need to spend time with logistics and moving the project to a dedicated space I intend to use

			 - for the light module I might need to do custom optics with a resin 3D printer which I haven't used before, as well as learn Blender and a plugin for the optical simulations

		 - **"Which aspects of my current work would I most want to be known for if I could only be recognized for one thing?"**
			 - I want to be recognized for the emotional responses my light sculptures create in the viewers. The subtle color transitions and slow motions give a relaxing, almost as if breathing with the viewer effect, while some of the rhythmic ones create surprise and aliveness

			 - I want to be recognized for the harmonious compositions between cutting-edge technology and organic forms, showing that the natural and the artificial are not in opposition

			 - I want to be recognized for the ability to create immersive light environments that alter perception and invite contemplation

		 - **"What specific milestones would indicate to me that I'm successfully balancing commercial viability with artistic integrity?"**
			 - "Successfully selling my first piece at a price that compensates fairly for both materials and my creative time, without compromising on the design elements most important to me."

			 - "Receiving positive feedback from both art critics/curators AND potential buyers on the same aspects of my work."

			 - "Developing a streamlined production process that reduces my time investment by 25% without sacrificing the quality or artistic intent of the pieces."

			 - "Creating a signature series of three pieces that share my core artistic vision while being accessible at different price points."

			 - "Establishing relationships with two galleries or online platforms that understand and respect my artistic approach while helping me reach new audiences."

			 - "Balancing my time so that 60% is spent on current production work and 40% on experimental new directions that may not have immediate commercial application."

			 - "Building a small but engaged collector base (5-10 people) who appreciate the artistic vision behind my work, not just its decorative value."

			 - "Being able to clearly articulate my pricing structure based on concrete factors (materials, time, complexity) that honors both my labor and artistic contribution."

			 - "Developing one new technique or feature every quarter that excites me artistically while also creating a marketable point of difference."

			 - "Creating documentation of my process that adds value to each piece sold without revealing proprietary techniques that make my work unique."
