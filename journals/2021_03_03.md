	 - I want to have fresh ideas about the problems I'm taking on

- I love it when
	 - I have ideas I haven't thought of before

- Essay ideas
	 - Resulting and the problem of fit
		 - Resulting
			 - mistaking the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome

			 - In poker this is when one makes a bet and thinks that's related to the outcome, when there might have been other factors at play (e.g. other's people's decisions that didn't take place during that play)

			 - Taleb
				 - One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision).

		 - As I am interviewing I find this very common with the questions asked
			 - the interview outcome depends often on situations I've been thru as if what resulted is always relevant to what I decided in the situation

			 - given there are many thing which I could have not decided upon there is some things I have control over the results, and there are many over which I don't

			 - for example they ask some question around process
				 - there is no right or wrong answer but there is the right "feel"

				 - one thing is around the problem of autonomy
					 - If I take independent action then I can be accused I don't care about the business context and I'm living in the technical world

					 - Yet many of the questions around the business context are not answered because of the technical context

		 - I say it's a problem of fit
			 - One fits in a company's context as an engineer when this resulting is similar between the company and the interviewee 

			 - For a good outcome one needs all elements at play to fit well
				 - the business context

				 - the technical context

				 - the execution context

			 - On the other hand there is a problem of discovering the right context of communication
