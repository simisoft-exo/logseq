	 - I got given the opportunities I got in mind 2 years ago around going for a back-end role

	 - I woke up at 6 today without an alarm clock

	 - that washing the bed sheets makes me less likely to masturbate the day after I cum

	 - I got the will to figure things out even when they get confusing

	 - I got a second offer from StatsBomb

- Deciding between VIOOH and StatsBomb
	 - Last time I had to decide between Juxt and uSwitch, and it was easy because one offer was much higher

	 - This time I also factor in whether I'm going for a tougher, soul draining job

	 - StatsBomb 
		 - wins on environment

		 - pays 50K and 6 shares - that I can use in 4 years

		 - I could probably push it to 60K, but I doubt I could go beyond 65K

		 - I get a sense of more front-endish work

		 - my gut says to go with it

		 - line manager is fairly front-end focused, he is also 5-6 years in his career
			 - seems to be more like the Enio type

		 - feels like the more energizing decision

	 - VIOOH 
		 - VIOOH pays 75K and offers me a hard problem to work on - DataOps

		 - seems to have a bit more of a trad culture

		 - people seem more tired at this company than at StatsBomb

		 - I'd have more opportunitie

		 - I'd accept the job if they agree to work abroad in the colder months 

		 - I'd regret not taking on it since that's what I've been telling myself I want for the past 2 years

		 - the more I think about it the more my gut comes in line with the mind

		 - I'd have to rise up the the demans

		 - i get a sense people there would be way more demanding than at StatsBomb

		 - I got a way more experienced line manager - he is 10 years on the market so i can trust he can better handle the politics

		 - I got a Tim Earl funk of mind when I did the exercise

		 - I feel like I'd end up hating this job and people already feel tired there

	 - when I'm stressed I either close in or get more verbose and unintelligible 

	 - a reliable poet and an unreliable mechanic
