	 - I managed to get my computer setup and run things locally by the end of the second day at the new job

	 - I'm full of energy and went three days in a row at a gym, 2 of them waking up without an alarm clock and was very happy doing the workouts

	 - I decided against going to the therapist I talked with last week because it didn't feel right in my gut and it was not a hell yes to go for it. It was way to much debate in my head

	 - I started journaling again and I'm managing my internal state fairly well, even as I'm going thru occasional tensing of my face when I make a mistake

	 - I decided to commit to one year of BJJ and sign up ahead

	 - I got a job I desired for years and that I desire to keep it and do a good job here

	 - I managed to not come for 6 days with 3, one of them not touching myself and two of them didn't feel like doing it when I felt the inner cue and desire to do so
		 - replaced with walks

		 - it's harder when I feel tired and I lie in bed and I feel like pressing myself against the bed or pillows

	 - I keep my word and I feel energised because of that
