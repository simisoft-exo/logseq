	 - I've played a few bad games and it's time to learn from my mistakes
		 - LOST - Lazarlazinsky - counter-attack plan worked until I didn't pay attention that I can bring more pieces into play https://www.chess.com/game/live/14482606717
			 - unusual opening for white with e3, d3, c3

			 - doubling when attacking the F bishop or taking with the queen?

			 - decided to block the progress

			 - decided to "bait" him to open more pawns queenside, though this gave him more space and my pieces felt crammed. I should've retreated my bishop further to E7, as my "baiting" allowed him to form a strong pawn chain on my castled king

			 - I planned to attack on his uncastled king

			 - when I started the checks I did not bring the queen into checking him and that made it easier for him to escape with the king, as well as let me make a mistake - checked with the rook but he captured it with the knight 

			 - didn't handle very well the bishop pair endgame, as they were quite closed and not so easy to maneuver

		 - LOST - mikew5555 - didn't pay attention to the opponent's bishop at the end of the diagonal - https://www.chess.com/game/live/14488154423
			 - felt crammed, though my pieces were developed. He went on to invade my castled king with the knight and I wanted to defend the F pawd with the bishop

			 - and I had 10 minutes left

			 - let him capture more pieces for free later, leaving him up quite a few pieces

			 - I gave a stupid check with the knight, without paying attention that it was a free capture by the rook

			 - after the check I didn't pay attention and develop my knights further

			 - followed by a check with his bishop that I didn't pay enough attention it could capture my pawn and give me a check

			 - mistake was to make it easy for him to make a mess of my position - took the bishop and doubled my pawns on the E file

		 - DRAW - thought I won the winning game and became lenient - my first rook vs knight endgame https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/14369839077
			 - mistake - captures a pawn instead of a knight with my advanced pawn

			 - should have brought my king closer to the center in the endgame

			 - gave him my bishop for free on my chase for not so well thought checks

			 - mistake - thought I won the game before winning it and made it easier for him to make my life hard

		 - LOST - mo_al_yamany - lost because I didn't pay attention that I pinned his pawn and could have checked him and won the game - https://www.chess.com/game/live/14566755921
