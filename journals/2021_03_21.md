- Looking in the mirror I see I procrastinated too much on fixing my posture
	 - It's been way too many years. While I've done face-pulls and so and so in the past two years it's not enough

- I feel anxiety and freeze when I have to deal with an idea that I need to articulate on the spot

- It's  toxic culture in a company if there is an incident or some pressure and no training or pairing is offered when that happens, and you're told you should just be able to deal with it
	 - If I were more experienced about this I would not complain because I would be used to it

	 - Since these situations don't happen that frequently it's hard to develop the habit 

	 - But there is no point in complaining about this if I don't prepare or make it easy to get the help for this

- I don't want this year to repeat the last year and it's already worse than the previous two with regards to training and work

- On [[April 26th, 2019]] I wrote a list of 10 vices I want to get rid of
	 - Done

			 - managed to give up nail biting for good in november 2020

		 - DONE delaying to recreate my art
			 - did recreate and sold another piece but nothing afterwards

		 - DONE skipping exercising
			 - more or less trained consistently for the past two years

			 - I'm still having days where I don't train because I don't feel like it and it shows
