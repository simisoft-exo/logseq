- DONE bjj
	 - trained with Mehmet - [[May 27th, 2021]]
		 - felt the mirror of egos trying to prove themselves

		 - I was stronger than him, though he didn't give up easily, or near the end

		 - I could overpower him - though it's not what I wanted to do

		 - I found it hard to do takedowns

	 - smaller guy, though quite agile

	 - Bruno's advice was to tap out early
		 - even if one does not feel the pain, once control is lost

		 - once the pain threshold passes it's likely that the injury can last for weeks, even months

	 - Once I broke out of a hold, or the opponent failed to submit I should go for it and get control of the situation - it aint' over until they tap out

		 - the idea was to go from [[closed guard]] to [[submission]]
			 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5SeCRensWQ
				 - most common ways of attack and defense

				 - [[armbar]]

			 - roger gracie showing different ways of keeping the closed guard 

		 - got beaten up, he was stronger than me and had better technique

		 - when escaping the lying hold he blocked the a going for the leg

		 - he succeded in submitting me
			 - three times from the back

			 - once in the triangle

			 - twice in an armbar

		 - I succeeded escaping only one to a side mount

		 - failed because 
			 - went for only one submission, the one that worked in the morning with the lapel strangle

			 - he made it hard to bring my arm under his knee to break his hold by blocking and holding the arm I went with

			 - I did not use or make more space to make it harder for him to keep the preventive moves

			 - my conditioning was weaker than his, as well as my strength

		 - TODO [[May 28th, 2021]] how can I escape [[armbar]] attacks?
			 - how can I prevent triangle attacks

			 - how can I get in better shape for bjj cardio?

			 - how can I get better at the floor hold?
