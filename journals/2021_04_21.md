- came after 3 days last night and this morning

- I feel like I've failed to keep my word

- I feel sore and like not going to the gym

- I've lied in bed last night instead of doing something, and I've done too little of the SQL thing

- before going to bed I accepted the VIOOH offer, even if I'm continuing the interviews, now I have the second technical discussion with StatsBomb
	 - I feel like I was a delayed second choice, and I feel that's what happened with a lot of applications. yet I'm lucky as I'm paid well, even if it is not for extremely popular companies

- modern sex & reproduction 
	 - life gives women a lot of free tickets - just be beautiful, pick the right man, you're already given good senses and intuition about how to do that and make sure our species survives

	 - picks dedicating one's life to the office

- DONE prep statsbomb interview

- DONE prep elcom interview
	 - they said they don't have open positions

- TODO prep Sound United interview?

- TODO prep Medino interview
	 - not sure I want to work there - office is in canary wharf and I'd like to move out of London where I get better air quality. I don't like the pollution anymore
