- Negotiation & Requirements clarification
	 - Negotiation books can be good for software engineers with the limitation that they teach you to deal with stakeholders that have an idea of what they want. 
		 - In software you have to deal with stakeholders that either don't know what they want, or they know it up to some vague descriptions like "features" or "make more money".

		 - This makes it a bit harder to navigate the situations and to clarify first what is required or find out what the users want.
