- Decided I'm quitting on Monday. Not one day more

- Had a chat with the sales dude from Lambda School and I'm thinking of going for that.

- Plan
	 - Quit job

	 - Start training rigorously
		 - Finish 1000 pull-ups challenge
			 - Do the rehab, mobility part of the program before jumping on pull-ups

			 - Do the rehab, adjustment thing today

			 - 

	 - Take a few weeks off to deepen my Clojure ecosystem knowledge
		 - funds: {{calc  26500+5444+871+500 + 3200}}
id:: 9933f11e-e88a-440e-bacd-1dc9bcf0b148

		 - rent in London for a year: {{calc  850*12}}
id:: edb53918-8987-4c77-87ba-9986b55a16f7

		 - school cost: {{calc  10815}}
id:: 778d9e92-c9b3-4cb0-a5fb-93cad916be71

		 - left with after a year of London rent and school {{calc  ((9933f11e-e88a-440e-bacd-1dc9bcf0b148)) - ((edb53918-8987-4c77-87ba-9986b55a16f7)) - ((778d9e92-c9b3-4cb0-a5fb-93cad916be71))}}

- Lambda School
	 - web track
		 - upside
			 - might be easier to lead

			 - working with more junior people

			 - better chance to improve my soft skill because there are more people to deal with

			 - I do enjoy teaching

			 - I see myself starting my own company and here are more of the skills I'd need when I want to go for that

			 - will be easier to pick up on

			 - will put me in a situation where I need to get better at managing myself and others

			 - the coin toss pointed to this

			 - more opportunities in this space

		 - downside
			 - might be paid less, even maybe as much as I'm paid now

			 - 100K/Year?

			 - will take much of my outside work hours in order to deal with the people problems

	 - data science track
		 - upside
			 - tougher

			 - will be paid better

			 - maybe paid enough to take more time off after a year of work

			 - USD 120K-150K/year - GBP 85K

			 - might make more money to bootstrap my own venture

			 - might get a job where I focus on one thing

		 - downside
			 - might end up working in a bigger compan

			 - might end up on the lower end of the competence scale because I would only have 6 months with it

			 - I still need good communication skills and to navigate between the different technical contexts

			 - might take much of my outside work hours in order to perform well

- Don't be surprised by the shit in your life
	 - you're staying into a soul sucking job

	 - For a few more hundred pounds

	 - For more than 3/4th of the time on this job I felt like leaving but I didn't

	 - No wonder I feel no joy
		 - I felt more joy when I was broke and eating from dumpsters

		 - I felt more joy as a gardener than in this company

		 - I have a desire to improve my skills, yet I don't

	 - I avoid discomfort
		 - of opening the fucking dating apps

		 - of writing every day

		 - of training every day with reasonable intensity
