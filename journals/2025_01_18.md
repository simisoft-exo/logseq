		 - I like I don't get too much detail and need to figure out on my own how to continue some situations because it has to be my identity, not a trick or technique I use that's supposed to work. I'm supposed to be that guy that can think on his feet when he's going through these situations.

		 - desire for sex vs desire for women, vs desire for how I want to be myself in relationship to sex and women and give myself direction and lead to where I want to be (game being about myself)

		 - using his line or approach (or ARCs)
			 - doesn't work because I imitate instead of coming up with my own

			 - coming up with my own works better as I 

	 - Dates - [[January 17th, 2025]]
		 - Maria Da Silva - some BD - too much SM
			 - she replied enthusiastically on The League
				 - no hassle, she just said Friday like I proposed

				 - was enthusiastic on whatsapp to confirm the date

				 - she moved it to be a bit later. I usually don't like it when they move around, especially to an earlier time. I went with it as I didn't want to rush, take my time to get ready too

			 - date plan
				 - went to station, checked out two pubs nearby and a way between them
					 - it turned out to work one of my dark alley kiss against the wall fantasies later when 

			 - started warm with a hug (like most first dates do)
				 - as we were walking from the station to the bar I told her I have a rule (stolen from Locario) that the first drinks we split
					 - she was taken a bit aback. When I went out first time with Mika to a concert, when we were eating before the concert I told her the meal is on her as I paid for the concert tickets. She was taken aback too

					 - I see that's a way to take the lead and test for her compliance, and show the lead after ordering when I tell the bartender we split
						 - you see her reaction, 
							 - if she's complying things are on, 

							 - if not then she's not into my vibe
								 - I should cut the date short and not waste my time on the questions they ask when they don't like the dates 
									 - they start asking shit about whether I'm seeing others (testing if I'm desperate for them or too lonely)
										 - I find this a disrespectful question, as I don't care who she's seeing

										 - told the one I didn't like that if I'm open for a combination with somebody else I'll invite her to join

									 - how long I've been on the dating apps ( they don't like inexperienced guys )

									 - if I have friends

									 - how I'm getting along with my flatmates

									 - if I'm close with my family

								 - give her 5-10 minutes, so it doesn't end abruptly: tell her I don't like being fake and just continue conversation because that's the socially acceptable thing to do. I think she's a good person but I don't feel much chemistry/connection/vibe and to have an open conversation about dating and relationships. A stranger is the best person to share some secrets with, they won't tell your friends as they don't know them, and you won't see them again to feel weird in a social setting. I found this to be a refreshing approach

					 - we picked a "reserved" table and got kicked off
						 - better to wait until we get a table I like
							 - I can say - let's stay at the bar until one of the tables gets free, and refuse to sit at a table where we're across each other

					 - giving compliments, but not simping
						 - compliment on the nuances of their eyes, to make it comfortable that I can make quite intense eye contact without saying much
							 - they say I get silent and serious and might not be comfortable with that

					 - saying I find their lips appetizing ( eyes and lips I can like even when I don't like the face)
						 - positive responses
							 - they can be

							 - I enjoy them too

						 - negative responses
							 - that's "weird"
								 - cut it short (the art of)

								 - art of the ending

					 - she made a compliment that I would be james bond's gadget guy
						 - Q - Quartermaster
							 - on my art projects I like to organise supplies, equipment and provisioning of parts and components

						 - If I were to pick a role in the military that would be
							 - socially it would be one of the highest for somebody from modest backgrounds can raise to having significant responsiblity

					 - talked about getting naked together (what context), or made a comment about how she's in bed

					 - how many dates until sex
						 - she complained about her being just another experience of mine and that I’m only “collecting” trophies/experiences instead of looking for something meaningful

						 - I don’t want to lie to make her feel special

						 - I tell her we start by keeping things just to sex for a few months. there’s no situationship with me where I lie that there might be a relationship when I don’t have an intention for one. once I think there is potential for that. I’ll also be clear about why or why not I might not lead things a I will tell you and I’ll move to do dates, but we’ll have to be consistent. I’m sure you have others that are colder than me that keep you in check and I’m not bothered much by that as long as I don’t ask about them and you won’t complain about them.

					 - jiu  jitsu convo lead into talking about me liking to restrain them

					 - after chatting about boundaries she broke them

					 - I made the mistake saying I can be a switch, but I found I couldn't, but this is I learnt about myself since I thought about it after the experience with Aline that said she wanted that, and considered it, but since then I don't like it. I get hard when they are soft and feminine, I don't like the switch. I aim for complete dominance, no switching, she can do that with the guys she enjoys it, no role-playing
