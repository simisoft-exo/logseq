- Yesterday I've been at the protest for everything where hundreds of thousands showed up at Hyde Park and Oxford Street

- Then went on to pick girls I like and take photos of them in Regents Park
	 - Primrose Hill and Regents canal proved to be a better place than the park.

	 - Camden Market was also extremely lively

	 - I got outside and did an hour of Parkour

	 - I gathered up the courage to play chess in Greenwich against somebody who's much better than me

- ((3875dfb0-f910-44e4-b277-168871281dc3))
	 - get on the path on how to get out of my own mind "funks"
		 - when I play chess

		 - when I'm programming or solving other problems that I avoid solving
