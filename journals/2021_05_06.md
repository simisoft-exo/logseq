- went at a shooting range today
	 - shot with a HK P30 and a HK MR 223

	 - The pistol felt louder and harder to control.
		 - one needs to focus on the front sight in order to aim well, which means the target is a bit blurred

		 - the range hushed my lesson because they had a sudden control coming in

		 - Paul, the guy with the big beard there told me they'd give me a 15% discount next time I show there

		 - I felt an adrenaline rush, a feeling similar to the one where I realised I came inside a woman without a condom, scared. It's not easy to keep cool with loud sounds and knowing that thing can kill.

		 - The rifle felt smooth. It seems there are fewer things better designed for good handling than guns, especially the HKs

		 - The rifle didn't feel like having a big recoil, it went fast and smooth.

		 - It was like going to Ammunation in GTA, where a guy opens a cabinet and asks you what would you like to shoot with.

		 - Even if I shot at very short ranges, 5m for the pistol and 15m for the rifle/carabine it didn't come easy. With each shot I got shivers and found it a bit harder to stay relaxed on focused for the next shot. I missed the shot once.
