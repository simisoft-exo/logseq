- stagnation - always a mistake

- got up today and did a bunch of squats, split squats and shoulder presses on the bench
	 - i already felt amazing

	 - drinking water brought my energy up

	 - this is THE fix for staying in bed
		 - i have the bench in front of me, there's literally no need to walk to the gym to do something

		 - i can change the vibe of my room
