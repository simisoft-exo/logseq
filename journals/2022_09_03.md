- I'm listening to my recluse/hermit thoughts
	 - I keep telling myself I'm not social, yet I crave company

	 - being social is like chess in some way

		 - there aren't that many new pieces or new moves

	 - As I attempt to write my intro to the TG group
		 - I notice how I feel ashamed of my lack of dating experience

		 - I notice how I feel weighed down for my strangeness

			 - due to my past escapades that I haven't reconciled well with

			 - due to my lack of social skills and embarrassment because of it

			 - due to my lack of motivation and past failure at each attempt that I've forgotten now because I gave up and became jaded and resentful
