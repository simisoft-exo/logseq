	 - I I got out of bed before 7 today

	 - I got a few more ideas about writing the aggregation correctly

- stop copy pasting code
	 - renzo's example for partition-with has a bug
		 - this sequence would not be partitioned correctly for a 20 minute window

		 - 
```clojure
(def should-partition [{:play-time "2009-05-04T13:10:28Z"}
                         {:play-time "2009-05-04T13:29:28Z"}
                         {:play-time "2009-05-04T13:38:31Z"}
                         {:play-time "2009-05-04T14:58:31Z"}])
```
