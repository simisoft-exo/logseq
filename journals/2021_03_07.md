	 - I enjoyed a few more drinks and played chess last evening

- I'm going thru some confusion
	 - I want again to do a lot of things
		 - learn poker

		 - get a decent game of chess

		 - learn to play the guitar
			 - this is ambiguous and might not get me very far

		 - Datalog and Roam Research

	 - Play a chess game every day

- Is anything bugging me?
	 - that it's hard to handle working with others when I sense being accused of not doing my work

	 - that I'm overwhelmed by how hard making software is

	 - that I'm overwhelmed by how hard is to plan and design programs that exceed what one can immediately remember

	 - that I want to do "new" things while I haven't gotten rid of the old ones that prevent me from from actually taking on them

	 - that I haven't strongly established the training habit

		 - writing tests

		 - writing documentation

		 - following up with Bruno

- empathy and reclusive
	 - playing chess I realised it's important to have an idea how an opponent thinks
		 - that's a form of empathy

	 - I enjoy thinking on my own
		 - yet this limits my life because of lack of empathy 

		 - yes,  it is hard, especially to empathise with what I disagree as that takes away from the energy I want to put into things I want and like to think about 

		 - it also puts me in a position where I don't have my empathy muscles flexed or trained and I make poorer decisions when others are involved
