- It's bugging me that I said I would change something this week and I haven't articulated what
	 - I'm in a proverbial job I don't enjoy, and I haven't enjoyed being an employee since I've got my first job

	 - I need to change something - especially the way I go about my day to day

	 - I'm during the second week I'm not going for it at the gym - I do the bare zero legs minimum

	 - I've taken on the thirst challenge today - yet in too much of a cowardly way - I had a double espresso in the morning, yet it was watered down so I got a bit of hydration.
		 - I was thirsty so even the little bit of bitter water tasted better

		 - I eat watery fruits like nectarines which makes it more bearable

		 - last time I went for a soup so I didn't have to put up with the thirst

		 - I fear being thirsty

	 - how much time I spend feeling dissociated from life

	 - how much time I spend wishing my life were different instead of pursuing something I wanted for years

- TODO call scottishwidows to see how I can move the money from them to Aegon at VIOOH - [[June 15th, 2021]]
