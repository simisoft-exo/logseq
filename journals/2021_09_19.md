- from the re-org/re-structuring I get a hit into my morale
	 - everybody in the team looks overwhelmed and are not that willing to help

	 - I got a set of systems to maintain and the amount of things I need to take on doubles
		 - from a biz perspective it can make sense as they are cutting costs, or re-allocating them

		 - it becomes hard to make things work as there is less and less willingness to do so

		 - even if one provides some direction (e.g. the knowledge matrix and "leaving plans") an overall sense of indifference, and even passive aggressively not giving what might be done leads for the ones who take over it in a position to have to re-learn and understand a systems that took months to years to build and there is no handover of much of that knowledge

		 - while being able to put up with such problems and push for solutions

		 - documentation does not replace people - it's just an indication of what's out there, often incomplete at best and frequently misleading
			 - thus knowledge transfer take time and those people's time will often have to be split between communicating, putting out fires, working on new features, fixing bugs, and pairing to hand over knowledge about the systems

			 - for helping newcomers a good metric is how long it took since they raised a concern until they were "unblocked"
