	 - I don't want situation that could have went well, not go well because
		 - I was frustrated or too focused on her red flags or resisting too much

		 - not interested because she's not into me

		 - or not interested because I'm doing something wrong

	 - stop and think
		 - just like there are incels, and awkward guys
			 - there are types of women of that
				 - most women won't be about it
					 - used to dealing with losers, and they have the same type of vibe and energy from what they dealt with

		 - homework
			 - work on paying more attention to the situation and focus more on here I'm trying to take the conversation to get what I want

			 - fall back from frustrating energy
				 - don't bring it to the interaction
					 - come with interaction with chill, positive, see where it could go, let's have some fun

		 - countering the interview
			 - interview stuff
				 - listen, this is not a job interview, 
					 - we're two sexy people, let's talk about sexy things
						 - I'm gonna ask you one thing that few guys ever asked you.
							 - Tell me on thing about you find sexy about how I look

				 - I keep hearing this
					 - next time when they say this, I'll say this response back
						 - I would get 9/10 this reaction

						 - it's going to lead me to this part
							 - how to respond to "I bet you tell that all the girls"
								 - I only say that to women I plan on having sex with

								 - Of course I say, all the girls want me, so I give the girls a chance with a fly guy like me

					 - 8mile - eminem's prepr-ready raps

			 - she's asking where what
				 - this isn't a job interview, we're two sexy people wanting to do sexy things
					 - let's talk about something we really wanna talk about

			 - women are always doing this
				 - when they do this I want to do that
					 - I only do women what I do after I have sex

			 - we're not going to talk, we're going to talk about

			 - they misinterpret the silence as disinterest?
				 - silence is awkward

		 - overall premise - primary topic - sensual, sexual
			 - everything that needs to be said is under that topic

			 - everything about and around
				 - I don't have to think, because all I need to talk about is about that

				 - we're trying to have fun tonight, not to get to know what we do for a living
					 - we're not doing business tonight, we're trying to have fun

	 - conversation
		 - whenever convo she should be following where I'm taking the conversation
			 - if she's not she's resisting

			 - you know, interview are for jobs, let's talk about something else
				 - her: no, I really wanna know
					 - me: you can get one more try, listen, I noticed that those jeans makes the curves on your legs look really good, you're always this sexy?
						 - if she responds, cool

						 - if she resists again, get to know each other - end the date

		 - trying to think of what to say
			 - I should be focused on the premise and moving the conversation forward with that
