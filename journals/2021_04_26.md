- Giving up a vice, addiction or bad habit can seem hard for the first few weeks. Yet once I get to he point I stop identifying with it and I get to a new self that experiences freedom from it I feel a sense of freedom and pride that I succeeded at something.
	 - the moment I reach that point is the moment I regret not giving up the habit earlier

	 - with masturbation I told myself I'm not going to cum until I connect well with somebody
