	 - lied in bed for about an hour and a half - masturbated, didn't come

	 - played 2 games of chess and lost

- did one 1 min hollow hold after I got up then decided to go for the pull-ups

- my thoughts during doing the pull-ups

- do I still want to feel like shit when I get up?
	 - if so I can keep doing what I'm doing

	 - the alternative to work is 
		 - the sense of dread and waste I'm going thru

		 - the sense that I'm not worth it and the effort is not worth it

	 - that I can keep going on like this instead of putting in the time and sweat to have a clear conscience that I pulled my own weight, that I learnt what I could learn and that there was nothing left that could have been up to me and didn't do it

- It took a decade to build the habit to be lazy, it can take years to get rid of it
	 - it took me more than 3 attempts to give up nail biting, now they look good, yet out of bordeom I still bite them, even if I don't do it very badly

	 - the enemy is relentless - he doesn't wait to feel good to do good
