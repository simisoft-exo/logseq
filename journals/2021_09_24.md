	 - went to the office and talked uselessly too much

	 - got responses from two companies, times to apply to more and ask for coffees

	 - example of reaching out from Gergely:  Hi X,

Y recommended I reach out to you as one of the best iOS engineers he's worked while at CompanyY. At Skyscanner I'm the first - and currently, only - iOS engineer in our new London offices and a relatively new tech lead as well and I'm looking for people to learn more from.

If you have time, love to buy you a coffee or lunch at a time and location that works conveniently for you. I'm really interested to chat about your experience on leading a team while being a top individual contributor, as well as any advice you might have about balancing tech work, recruiting and mentoring others. In return, I'd be happy to share my views on iOS, how I'm approaching building a new app and anything else that you might find interesting.

I also understand that you might be busy, so no worries if you wouldn't have the time!
