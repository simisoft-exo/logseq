- #eating-accountability
	 - measured to 74.6 kg this morning

	 - even as I'm not holding myself strongly accountable the habit to eat a bit more than usual has helped.

	 - with little tracking I got to 74. What will it take to get to 80?

- stuff I want to shoot away today
	 - DONE scheduling lunch with Greg

	 - DONE pinging a bunch of people from the past

- figuring out what's next for jobs
	 - full-stack?

	 - data engineering?

	 - backend?
