- 5 steps date "formula" - [[February 28th, 2025]]
	 - each step about ~10 min

	 - 1. **regular small talk** 
		 - day, doing, where from bla bla

	 - 2. **verbal flirting** ~ 10 min, not more without touching (with some little small talk)
		 - rugby/sporty guys - they are very physical
			 - I think you're the kind of gal that likes to get with this kind of physical guys with whom sex is a contact sport
				 - rugby is a contact sport, I know another contact sport that we can do in the bedroom

				 - tackle you into bed

		 - don't need to flirt the whole 5 min, go back and forth between small talk and flirting

		 - **when responsive** (is there cooperation or resistance)
			 - 3. **touching** - flirting & touching for ~5-8 min then kissing (with some flirting, and less small talk)
				 - tell her to do something or smoothly transition into it

				 - soft hands -> her hand in my hand

				 - move to touch her knees

				 - arm around her -> 

				 - 4. **kissing** - announce & kiss - for about ~7-10 min - don't go over, without pulling out of the spot
					 - escalation and transition to next part

					 - excuse or logistical
						 - second date: listen - next time, let's get together next week, have a drink at my place and continue where we left off
							 - just get her to my place the second time

							 - resistance about coming to my place (whatever I don't know)
								 - she's not that into it / she's not highly interested

								 - listen, there's no problem, you have my number, when you're ready to make it happen, hit me up.

					 - it's a little too much for the public, we need to get out of here and get to my place

					 - 5. **getting back to my place**

		 - locario's vibe
			 - I have a "super" player vibe
				 - this guy

				 - you got 10 other women
					 - sign of medium interest
						 - hone in on me and her
							 - I do date, but I'm really atttracted to you and want to see where this can go with me and you

							 - if she responds positively

		 - resistance is indicator to end the date
			 - kissing, resistance
				 - her: i don't think it's time for that
					 - I'm going to end the this in the next minute or two
