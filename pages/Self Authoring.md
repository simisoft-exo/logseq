- One Thing You Could Do Better
id:: d49a1420-45cb-498f-af8a-c79b16afd5e3
	 - [[April 8th, 2021]] - one week after quitting uswitch
		 - back when I wrote was just after the one click switch delivery

		 - after that I managed to pull of the SSE deal and the ABC test

		 - the lockdown after that and the maintenance work sucked the life out of me

		 - I still struggle with that aim
			 - I failed at taking on the maintenance work

			 - I managed to do some advent of code on the side, but stopped after 12 days or so

			 - I struggle being concise in speech and selecting the relevant context for the audience

			 - I can ideate and have a concept of what's needed, yet I struggle with application and finding the right fit between the ideas and reality

			 - I fail to understand the context well enough to know what solution would be suited, or what kind of solution to look for

			 - I get a sense that it's easier to do better in interviews when I talk about the effort of finding the right fit, and how I got there rather than about all the things I know

			 - at uswitch I saw how the more "senior" engineers were coaching those just a bit under their skill to get better, yet their attention was limited, and too often in catch-ups things weren't about that, but about the "interesting" stuff I was reading or thinking about, rather than "work"

		 - the version of me that would be proud of myself is the one that would come back to this and say that is dealing better with the problems above

		 - the version of me that would be proud of myself is the one that would build on a daily habit and that will look at it in a month's time and say yes, I kept up with it and improved on some of the things [[May 8th, 2021]]
			 - that thing would be learning to select information and put it in a digestible format for a non-technical person

		 - 

	 - (after a year and a half at uswitch)
		 - Make a daily effort to put together my communication, collaboration and programming skills. Both need an upgrade at the same time and improve the interface between the two by understanding how to design and how to make the right trade-offs when I'm making it a reality, as well as make an effort to understand the business context and how my designs fit into it. I'm making an effort to understand that. The part with the daily effort is still something I struggle with, at least when it comes to deep work and learning new things besides the main job.

		 - The thing to do better is to become effective at putting together the business context and the technical side.

	 - (after two months of learning how to program at Codurance) 
		 - Make a consistent, daily effort to improve my programming skills. I want to learn how to design and write good programs, as well as having a good connection with those who want it. I want to be able to articulate my programming decisions and also to start building a good reputation within the company. I can do this by becoming highly skilled and finding problems that I can solve and become good at solving, as well as having discussions around it and putting myself on the line as much as I'm capable of it.

	 - (old answer, before I joined Hirsch&Mann) 
		 - Make a consistent effort to build up a skill. I think the skill I'd like to build is to better sell my ideas and build what I dream. I'm not sure yet what that thing is. I just know it's around product development, electronics and programming. If there's a skill I'd like to do much better at is programming. So I see I have two things here. One of them is developing physical products with programming the other is selling my own ideas.

- Things to Learn About
	 - set around [[September 1st, 2020]]
		 - six months - [[April 8th, 2021]]
			 - I'd like to contribute to an open-source project
				 - ((01843730-f397-4744-8716-0c16f80ed4c4))

			 - I'd like to become more of a JavaScript expert
				 - didn't get much better in one year of JS and TS

			 - DONE I'd like to learn how to setup staging and production environments on my own
				 - did with the migration

			 - DONE I'd like to move onto a fully remote job where I earn 70-80K per year
				 - didn't get there as of [[April 8th, 2021]]

				 - got a 75K offer and started it on [[May 17th, 2021]]

				 - I'm working as a contractor  from [[July 4th, 2022]]
					 - making 515t GBP/day - about 110K/year before tax

			 - DONE I'd like to move into a studio apartment
				 - DONE moved in on [[January 1st, 2021]] into an en-suite room

				 - DONE moved again on [[August 1st, 2021]]

				 - DONE move again on [[May 21st, 2022]]  - en-suite room

			 - I'd like to make my first investments
				 - gambled with Bitcoin - initially won, then lost more than I wozzzz

		 - two years [[September 1st, 2022]] - check-in on [[September 1st, 2021]]
			 - ~~I'd like to take on a role as a senior full-stack web engineer.~~
				 - seems like there are a few years to go to get there

				 - changed to data egineer

				 - [[September 1st, 2022]] - managed to get a well paid job at #Exoscale as a contractor
					 - I'm full-stack, working the first few months on the API layer
						 - I feel I'm stagnating though. The company moves slow, and I don't feel motivated with a lot of things, especially on taking my own initiative.

						 - 

			 - I'd like to enjoy a loving, trusting and respectful relationship with a woman for more than a year.
				 - [[April 8th, 2021]] - spent too much time masturbating and fantasizing about all the women I already fucked

				 - [[November 21st, 2021]] not much change

				 - [[September 1st, 2022]] - still stuck masturbating. 
					 - I took on habit-breakers, and also on Gabor Mate's approach to dealing with addiction to keep fighting. 

					 - Had a month of tracking it so far and I keep failing. 

					 - With each fail and day I fight I see the desire to get rid of this habit needs to be renewed and each moment I succeed leads me closer to defeating that weak self and adopting a better self and character

					 - I will not let relapses and swinging back to doing it from time to time deter me from completely giving up on this habit and replacing it with healthy one that will lead me to the relationships that will enrich my and their lives.

					 - I'm crying seeing this as I feel guilt, shame and criticise myself for being weak. I'm grateful for Realm of Hungry Ghosts because I learnt this habit might be so ingrained I've lost control over what that urge means for me and my life. In a way it's freeing as I blame my current self less, and I focus on regaining this control, urge by urge, fantasy by fantasy, moment by moment. The sum of all coming moments must be on the positive and it matters less that I relapse, as long as I keep tracking and conquering.

					 - check in another month - [[October 1st, 2022]] 

			 - I'd like to be able to live abroad half of the year where I can enjoy the sun, good women, and mountain climbing.

			 - [[November 21st, 2021]] - still doing a bad job of this at VIOOH

			 - [[September 1st, 2022]] - still struggling with this at Exoscale

					 - I jump too fast to what I want to say, instead of listening what the others want to say.

	 - Friends
		 - I'd like to have one or two more friends besides Mihai with whom I can discuss issues openly.

		 - With friends I'd like to be a better listener and be slower in the way I'm eating, drinking and connecting with them. I'd like to have a better habit at connecting with them, as well as keeping in touch.

		 - I want to get to a circle of friends with whom I can have engaging conversations, to whose life I can contribute, and whom can contribute to my life.

		 - A dream I have is to get to a parkour training crew that I get to train with in London, as well as an adventure crew with whom I can go on mountain adventures.

	 - Smoking, alcohol and drugs

		 - I will only smoke seldomly and when I'm with others. If I decide to go out on my own on a night I should get a pack of cigarettes and share.

		 - When I achieve some personal aim I want to reward myself with a fine cigar, ever other month or so.
