- camera game
	 - I've been out [[April 17th, 2021]] and [[April 18th, 2021]] in Hyde & Green Parks, taking pictures
		 - [[April 17th, 2021]]
			 - I got approached by 2 girls to take pictures of them, then I "counter-approached" and got a "smile :)" on the prompt

			 - then I went further, wandered a bit and saw a girl under a tree, Hannah, who was reading Murakami
				 - went to her and we chatted, and her prompt was "warmth"

				 - lots of talking, she's 19 or 20. oversharing gen z.

				 - taught her a few words of Romanian, as she studies Spanish and German

		 - [[April 18th, 2021]]
			 - wandered then went to a girl under a majestic tree, Anna, greek cypriot studying law in the UK
				 - she noticed I'm anxious and said that's how I deal with it, using the camera

				 - she improvised a poem in greek, of which I understand nothing

				 - after a bit of a chat I got her insta

			 - got rejected by a girl with a red jacket

			 - then wandered to green park and approached two Russian women
				 - the older one was very direct with me
					 - so what do you do?

					 - engineer, but quit

					 - why did you quit?

					 - where can we see these pictures?

				 - this one was the toughest. got a bit shaken by her directness. reminds me of Aline Sanchez's directness. same you should be a responsible adult attitude, with good intentions behind, I'm pretty sure. i felt it like she held a mirror to my struggle, her prompt was encouraging me to keep doing what I'm doing, adding that it would be good to dance. I left, without sharing the pictures, I didn't feel they were good enough or that the connection was appropriate. Her friend sought to get her permision, she had penetrating green eyes that were looking at you, in you and through you.
					 - fucking russians
