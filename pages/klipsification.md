- Talked with dvargas and he suggested I have a look at maps or charts if I want a [[REPL]] - https://github.com/dvargas92495/roam-js-extensions/pull/330/files

- Example of how to embed Klipse for a REPL

- I can test locally using https://github.com/dvargas92495/roam-js-extensions/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-setup

- TODO [[February 19th, 2021]] - have a working model, without the styling at some point
